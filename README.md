# NetworkPointsWalker

This project is a POC of graph usage.

## Scope

The primary objective of the project is to demonstrate the efficiency of a "standard-ish" implementation against homemade algorithm
I will use AStar algorithm to determine the length of the most efficient path before using a separate algorithm to find alternate paths.

## Data

All the data come from the RINF referential and are publicly available
